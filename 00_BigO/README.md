# Algorith-MX Group - Session 0
# Topic: Big O Notation

According to what we reviewed during the Tuesday, November 22 session A.K.A. _session 0_, work on the following task which has at least 3 possible solutions, each one with a different Big O complexity.

### Task:
**Assume you have an array of integers. You want to find the pairs of numbers within that array which sum equals a given number.**
_Try to find and code as many solutions as possible, this to compare and understand different complexities_

### Input example: 

```
Input Array: [12, 4, 2, 7, 9, 27, 1, 3, 8, 6, 5, 0]
Number to search: 7
```

### Output example:

```
{{4,3}, {2,5}, {7,0}, {1,6}}
```

### Assumptions
You can code your solution considering (or not) the following assumptions:

1. The order of the results does not matter
2. The array contains unique elements
3. The array holds only positive numbers

#### Let's keep our code clean and beautiful!
