Problem #1

  You have an unsorted integer array which contains numbers from 1 to n but one number is missing.
  Write a program (or pseudo-code) to find that missing number.

  Example 
    Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}
    Output: 7


Problem #2

Given an unsorted array of numbers, j and k, you need to find the jst smallest and the kst largest numbers in the array. 

  Example 
    Input: {1, 3, 7, 9, 4}, j=2, k = 3
    Output: 
      jst smaller number (j=2) is: 3
      kst greater number (k=3) is: 4
